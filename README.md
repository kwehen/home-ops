# Home Enterprise Operations == A Bunch of YAML

A collection of code, yaml, notes, and more which run my "Enterprise" at home. I've built, detroyed, rebuilt, and migrated things enough times to feel that this can somewhat be standardized. I can destroy everything today and be back up in a few hours. Shoutout to Git.

I'll add more stuff as this goes, but for now:
- kubernetes - Kubernetes Cluster
- talos - basic configuration for Talos Linux
